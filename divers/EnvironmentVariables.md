# Environment Variables

## What is it ?

An environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect the way running processes will behave on a computer. 

## Windows

### Definition

By default, Windows uses certain environment variables to allow users to quickly access certain paths and directories within the operating system. This helps to make Windows easier to navigate. By defining and setting up your own custom environment variables, you can create direct paths and shortcuts to apps, directories, URLs and more.
Environment variables in Windows are queued by percent (%) characters.

Example : 
```
%appdata%
%temp%
%userprofile%
%homepath%
```
### Add, edit or delete environment variables

Click on the Start button and type in **environment variable** into the search box. Click on **Edit the system environment variables**.

This will open up the **System Properties** dialog to the **Advanced** tab. Click on the **Environment Variables** button at the bottom.

#### Add

Click the New button listed under the User variables section. This will present you with the New User Variable window, where you can define a variable name and a variable value.
- **The Variable name**: text area lets you define a simple name for the environment variable. 
- **The Variable value**: text area lets you define a path or other value that is triggered when the variable name is used.
